  # About

    content: |-
      I'm a software engineer with professional experience in Java and Spring. I enjoy building things from the front end all the way to the backend, and I care about making technology approachable and enjoyable to use.

      Right now, I'm working on releasing a modern Go/Weiqi app that focuses on great usability—something I feel is missing from the current options out there. For this project, I'm using Xcode, Swift, SwiftUI, and Supabase.

      I also love experimenting with reinforcement learning, especially training agents in virtual environments like video games. Exploring the intersection of technology, learning, and play is something that excites me every day.
